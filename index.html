This specification describes mechanisms that can be used to represent a
Verifiable Credential through a visual, auditory, or haptic medium. It covers
rendering a Verifiable Credential to a physical document, digital image,
screen reader, or braille output.

This is an experimental specification and is undergoing regular revisions. It is
not fit for production deployment.

    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
Rendering methods can be used when the <a>issuer</a> has a specific way that
they want to express a <a>verifiable credential</a> to an observer through
a visual, auditory, or haptic mechanism. For example, an <a>issuer</a> of an
employee badge credential might want to include rich imagery of their corporate
logo and specific placement of employee information in specific areas of the
badge. They might also want to provide an audio read out of the important
aspects of the badge for individuals that have accessibility needs related
to their eyesight.

      <section id="conformance">
        <p>
A <dfn>conforming render method</dfn> is any concrete expression of the data
model that complies with the normative statements in this specification.
Specifically, all relevant normative statements in Sections
<a href="#data-model"></a> and <a href="#algorithms"></a>
of this document MUST be enforced.
        </p>

        <p>
A <dfn class="lint-ignore">conforming processor</dfn> is any algorithm realized
as software and/or hardware that generates or consumes a
<a>conforming render method</a>. Conforming processors MUST produce errors when
non-conforming documents are consumed.
        </p>
        <p>
This document also contains examples that contain JSON and JSON-LD content. Some
of these examples contain characters that are invalid JSON, such as inline
comments (`//`) and the use of ellipsis (`...`) to denote
information that adds little value to the example. Implementers are cautioned to
remove this content if they desire to use the information as valid JSON or
JSON-LD.

      <h2>Data Model</h2>

      <p>
The following sections outline the data model that is used by this specification
for rendering methods
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>The `renderMethod` Property</h3>

        <p>
The `renderMethod` property is a
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#reserved-extension-points">
reserved extension point</a> in the Verifiable Credentials Data Model
specification [[VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]]. An <a>issuer</a> can utilize this
property in a <a>verifiable credential</a> to express one or more preferred
render methods.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><var>renderMethod</var></dt>
          <dd>
The value of the `renderMethod` property MUST specify one or
more rendering methods that can be used by software to express the
<a>verifiable credential</a> using a visual, auditory, or haptic mechanism. Each
`renderMethod` value MUST specify its `type`, for example,
`SvgRenderingTemplate2023`. The precise contents of each rendering
hint is determined by the specific `renderMethod` `type`
definition.
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>SvgRenderingTemplate2023</h4>

        <p>
When an <a>issuer</a> desires to specify SVG rendering instructions for a
<a>verifiable credential</a>, they MAY add a `render` property that uses the
data model described below.
        </p>

        <table class="simple">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th style="white-space: nowrap">Property</th>
              <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>id</td>
              <td>
A URL that dereferences to an SVG image [[SVG]] with an associated
`image/svg+xml` media type.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>type</td>
              <td>
The <code>type</code> property MUST be <code>SvgRenderingTemplate2023</code>.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>name</td>
              <td>
A name that can be used by a display to express the type of rendering that
is associated with the render method. This property might be used in a
graphical interface that enables an individual to select between multiple
presentation modes.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>css3MediaQuery</td>
              <td>
A CSS Level 3 Media Query that can be used to specify desired characteristics
in the display device. If there are multiple render methods, the best match
to the CSS Level 3 Media Query will be used by default. It is expected that
an individual could override this preference through a manual process.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>digestMultibase</td>
                <td>
An optional multibase-encoded multihash of the SVG image. The multibase value
MUST be `z` and the multihash value MUST be SHA-2 with 256-bits of output
(`0x12`).
                </td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>

          <p>
The data model shown above is expressed in a <a>verifiable credential</a>
in the example below.
          </p>

          <pre class="example nohighlight"
          title="Usage of the render property by an issuer">

  }]
  </span>
}
        </pre>

        <p>
In the example above, the <a>issuer</a> has provided an SVG rendering template
for a bachelor's degree that will be filled in with the information in the
<a>verifiable credential</a>. The rendering is preferred when the device or
paper is in a portrait (display is taller than it is wider) orientation.
        </p>

    <h2>Algorithms</h2>

    <p>
The following sections outline the algorithms that is used by this specification
for rendering methods.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h5>Render (SvgRenderingTemplate2023)</h5>

      <p>
The following algorithm is used to transform the SVG image template into the
final SVG image that is displayed. The inputs to the algorithm are the
<a>verifiable credential</a> (`verifiableCredential`) and the SVG image
source code (`svgImage`). The output is a SVG image.
      </p>

      <ol class="algorithm">
        <li>
Generate a map, `replacementMap`, by finding all strings in `svgImage` that
start with `{{` (double open braces) and end with `}}`
(double close braces). For each string, `templateKey`, that is found:
            <ol class="algorithm">
              <li>
Generate another string, `templateValue`, by evaluating the value of
`templateKey` (without the opening or closing braces) using the JSON
Pointer [[RFC6901]] algorithm with the `verifiableCredential` as input to the
algorithm. If the evaluation is `null`, set `templateValue` to the empty string.
              </li>
              <li>
Set a key in `replacementMap` by using `templateKey` and associate it with
`templateValue`.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
For every key in `replacementMap`, replace each corresponding
string in `svgImage` that matches the key with the associated value in the
`replacementMap`.
          </li>
        </ol>
